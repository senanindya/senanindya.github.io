There are a range of route-planning solutions available in daily use. When it comes to emergency circumstances, speed and efficiency are more important than luxury. The vast majority of these vehicles fall short of delivering swift and efficient transportation services. Our research resulted in the creation of a functional route-planning system for emergency services that may be used in a range of applications of electronic driver assistance, including those supplied by online emergency service providers. Real-Time Vehicle Navigation Systems most often employ a base map in combination with technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET), Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), and several sensors, to determine the location of a transport on the road. A real-time mechanism is crucial in an emergency; nevertheless, it is also necessary to have a time and energy-efficient route plan that varies according to geographic location, such as urban or rural regions. In this paper, we have researched with the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed solution on simulation which is based on maps provided by Google Maps for going from location A to B on different geographic situations. These findings indicate that the proposed strategy may be beneficial.
